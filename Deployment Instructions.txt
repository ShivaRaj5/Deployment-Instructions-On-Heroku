Steps to deploy your app on Heroku --- >>>
1. First of all create a seperate client and server folder for frontend and backend.
2. When your app is ready, push the client folder into server folder.
3. Go to server/client folder and write command npm run build, it will build the custom deployment environment for production.
4. Write this into your server's app.js/index.js file --- >>> 
	if(process.env.NODE_ENV=="production"){
    		app.use(express.static("client/build"));
	}
5. Make sure that there should not be a get or post or any request to "/" otherwise it will render the server's "/" route than client's "/" route.
6. Remove the proxy from client's package.json because client and server are running on same port so we do not need any proxy to send the request.
7. If there is any request in client's ".js" file "localhost:5000/getdata" then change it to "/getdata".
8. After all these things have been done, to deploy our app on heroku make sure to delete the package-lock.json file of server.
9. Remove port number from .env file and write port name in your server's index.js file as --->>>
	const PORT=process.env.PORT || 5000
10. Login to heroku and create a new app.
11. Click on the settings then click on the reveal config vars and write all the key-value pairs of your server's .env file into it.
12. Make sure that your MERN app is not already a git repository if it is so delete .git file.
13. Go to your MERN app then to /server --- >>> 
	npm init
	heroku git:clone -a <mern-app> 
	git add .
	git commit -am "All files have been added"
	git push heroku master
